# Park Activity Video Analytics Dataset Plan

## Goal

Build a video-based dataset and analytics pipeline to measure park usage, movement, activities, social interaction, and nature exposure from fixed outdoor camera videos.

The final dataset should support hourly summaries of:

- Bike activity
- Pedestrian activity
- Visitor counts
- Time spent in the park
- Distance to trees or lake as a proxy for nature exposure
- Common activity types
- Group presence and social interaction proxy
- Apparent child percentage as a proxy for age-group friendliness

## 1. Target Outputs

| Metric | Output | Method | Reliability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hourly bike activity | Number of bikers per hour | Detect and track bicycles/cyclists | High |
| Hourly pedestrian activity | Number of pedestrians per hour | Detect and track persons | High |
| Visitor counts | Unique tracked visitors per hour | Track ID counting inside park ROI | High |
| Time spent in park | Dwell time per visitor | Track duration inside park ROI | Medium-High |
| Nature exposure proxy | Distance/time near tree or lake | Person-to-ROI distance | Medium |
| Activity range | Walking, biking, sitting, talking, etc. | Rule-based labels plus activity classifier | Medium |
| Social connection proxy | Group size and group duration | Distance plus movement similarity | Medium |
| Child percentage | Apparent child / total visible people | Manual labels plus classifier | Medium-Low |

Important: “Feeling connected to nature” and “getting to know new people” cannot be directly measured from video. They should be reported as visual proxies, not direct psychological outcomes.

## 3. Annotation Plan

| Annotation Type | Labels | Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Object detection | person, bicycle, cyclist, stroller, dog | CVAT / Label Studio | Count people and bikes |
| Tracking | track_id for each person/biker | CVAT / auto-tracking | Visitor count and dwell time |
| Park zones | path, grass, lake, tree area, pavilion, entrance, exit | Manual polygon | Zone-based analysis |
| Activity labels | walking, running, biking, sitting, standing, talking, playing, dog walking, exercising, picnic | CVAT / Label Studio | Activity diversity |
| Age proxy | apparent_child, adult, uncertain | Manual label | Child percentage |
| Group label | group_id | Manual plus rule-based | Social interaction proxy |

## 4. Video Sampling Strategy

| Sampling Unit | Plan |
|---|---|
| Cameras | Use all available fixed camera views |
| Days | Sample weekdays and weekends |
| Time periods | Morning, noon, afternoon, evening |
| Weather | Include sunny, cloudy, and low-light conditions if available |
| Annotation density | Start with 5–10 minutes per hour |
| Initial labeled data | 500–2,000 frames for detection; 200–500 short clips for activity labels |

## 5. Model Pipeline

| Step | Model / Method | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Frame extraction | FFmpeg / OpenCV | Timestamped frames |
| Object detection | YOLO / RT-DETR | Person, bicycle, cyclist boxes |
| Multi-object tracking | ByteTrack / BoT-SORT | Consistent track IDs |
| ROI segmentation | Manual polygons; optional SAM/SAM2 | Lake, tree, path, grass regions |
| Activity recognition | Rule-based first; later MMAction2 / VideoMAE / SlowFast | Activity label per track segment |
| Group detection | Distance plus motion similarity | Group ID and group size |
| Child proxy | Manual labels first; later fine-tuned classifier | apparent_child / adult / uncertain |
| Metric aggregation | Python / Pandas | Hourly metrics table |

## 12. Key Notes

- Use “apparent child” instead of “child” to avoid claiming true age.
- Use “nature exposure proxy” instead of “feeling connected to nature.”
- Use “group/social interaction proxy” instead of “getting to know new people.”
- Do not report raw identities or face-level information.
- Blur faces if releasing public videos or frames.
- Always report model error rates with the final metrics.
